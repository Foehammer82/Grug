The Grug app is a Discord bot designed to assist groups of people who play tabletop RPGs, such as Dungeons and Dragons
(DnD) or Pathfinder. It offers a variety of features aimed at enhancing the gaming experience and managing group
activities. The project was initiated to streamline the management of attendance and food schedules for tabletop RPG
groups, but has since expanded to include capabilities like image generation and answering questions.
