## Motivation

The motivation for this project started from looking for a tool to help manage attendance tracking and food schedules
for the group I play DnD/Pathfinder with. I wanted to create a bot that could handle these tasks, and also be able to
generate images and answer questions from the group. I also wanted to be able to have a way to interact with the bot
outside of Discord, so I created a FastAPI application that can be used to interact with the bot.
