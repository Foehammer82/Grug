# TODO: this is where all the logic for handling food, food reminders, etc will go.
#       The idea is that interfaces and all other application components should come here to do anything related to
#       food.  so that we keep everything loosely coupled and avoid having a situation where the food logic depends on
#       something like discord or sms or whatever, and instead creating tools for food that the interfaces leverage
#       abstractly.
