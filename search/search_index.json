I wanted to create a bot that could handle these tasks, and also be able to generate images and answer questions from the group. I also wanted to be able to have a way to interact with the bot outside of Discord, so I created a FastAPI application that can be used to interact with the bot.</p>"},{"location":"about/privacy_policy/","title":"Privacy policy","text":""},{"location":"about/privacy_policy/#privacy-policy-grug","title":"Privacy Policy - Grug","text":""},{"location":"about/privacy_policy/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Grug is committed to protecting your privacy.
